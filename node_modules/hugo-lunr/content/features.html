<h2>What makes PageProofer so easy to use?</h2>

<h3 class="bottom-space">We purposely built it for clients to use.</h3>

<p class="x-large bottom-space">The majority of web development teams don&#39;t use any feedback or issue tracking software. The primary reason is people don&#39;t want to learn a new system. PageProofer is designed to be the easiest way to leave feedback during website development.</p>

<h3>Embed in your website, no plugins, no software</h3>

<p>PageProofer provides all the functionality right on your website. Add a code snippet into the footer of your website and you are up and running. It&#39;s that easy.</p>

<h3>Use in any browser, any time</h3>

<p>View your site in any browser on any device (desktop, tablet, smart phone). If something isn&#39;t right, make a note about it, right there. We support Firefox, Internet Explorer (8+), Safari, Chrome and Opera across multiple platforms. We&#39;ve got you covered.</p>

<h2>How does PageProofer help your team and clients?</h2>

<h3 class="bottom-space">Everything is in one place</h3>

<p class="x-large bottom-space">All the feedback, notes and comments are available securely, right on your website. No more digging around for emails, trying to find a spreadsheet or using cumbersome bug tracking software. Your clients have a single place to leave feedback and your team has a single place to find it.</p>

<h3>Track issues and resolutions</h3>

<p>If you see an issue on your website, make a note about it right there. Once the issue is resolved or someone comments on it you get a notification. No more waiting for someone to document all the issues and then send an email around to everyone.</p>

<h3>Instantly know more</h3>

<p>On every note that is created, we capture the browser information and screen size. You don&#39;t need to guess about the browser or device, we show you. This allows you to quickly see all the important browser information (browser type, version, OS) and screen size data (desktop, tablet, mobile).</p>

<h3>Have the conversation in a single place</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t try to keep track of emails and spreadsheet notes, simply track the conversation right on the note.</p>

<h3 class="bottom-space">Second, it allows your team to see the whole picture</h3>

<p class="x-large bottom-space">The dashboard allows you to quickly see which pages have feedback, what the status of each note is and who is responsible for the task. Click any item to see the full details including the browser info and any conversation about the note. Need to see the problem first hand? Link directly to the page a note was left on to see the exact context.</p>

<p class="x-large bottom-space">Drag and drop notes between columns to quickly manage your workflow and assign priorities so nothing gets missed. Keep everybody and everything in sync.</p>
