The primary reason is people don&#39;t want to learn a new system. PageProofer is designed to be the easiest way to leave feedback during website development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n\n\n\nEmbed in your website, no plugins, no software\n\nPageProofer provides all the functionality right on your website. Add a code snippet into the footer of your website and you are up and running. It&#39;s that easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree clicks to leave feedback\n\nOnce you have added the PageProofer code snippet to your website every page is ready for your team to leave feedback. Click on the PageProofer logo to slide out the overlay and then double click anywhere on the page to add a note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse in any browser, any time\n\nView your site in any browser on any device (desktop, tablet, smart phone). If something isn&#39;t right, make a note about it, right there. We support Firefox, Internet Explorer (8+), Safari, Chrome and Opera across multiple platforms. We&#39;ve got you covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHow does PageProofer help your team and clients?\n\nEverything is in one place\n\nAll the feedback, notes and comments are available securely, right on your website. No more digging around for emails, trying to find a spreadsheet or using cumbersome bug tracking software. Your clients have a single place to leave feedback and your team has a single place to find it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrack issues and resolutions\n\nIf you see an issue on your website, make a note about it right there. Once the issue is resolved or someone comments on it you get a notification. No more waiting for someone to document all the issues and then send an email around to everyone.\n\nInstantly know more\n\nOn every note that is created, we capture the browser information and screen size. You don&#39;t need to guess about the browser or device, we show you. This allows you to quickly see all the important browser information (browser type, version, OS) and screen size data (desktop, tablet, mobile).\n\nHave the conversation in a single place\n\nDon&#39;t try to keep track of emails and spreadsheet notes, simply track the conversation right on the note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\nSecond, it allows your team to see the whole picture\n\nThe dashboard allows you to quickly see which pages have feedback, what the status of each note is and who is responsible for the task. Click any item to see the full details including the browser info and any conversation about the note. Need to see the problem first hand? Link directly to the page a note was left on to see the exact context.\n\nDrag and drop notes between columns to quickly manage your workflow and assign priorities so nothing gets missed. Keep everybody and everything in sync.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t   \n\n\n3rd Party Integration\n\nIs your team using a project management or collaboration tool?
