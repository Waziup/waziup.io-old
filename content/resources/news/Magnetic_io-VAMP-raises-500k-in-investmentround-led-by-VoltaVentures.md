**DevOps and business teams use VAMP to reduce downtime, improve time-to-market and increase performance of online software.**

**AMSTERDAM, May 23, 2016** — Magnetic.io, an Amsterdam-based hi-tech startup that develops opensource solution VAMP (http://vamp.io), today announced that it has raised € 500,000 in a round led by Volta Ventures. 
VAMP adds powerful canary testing and releasing, and autoscaling features to (Docker) container and microservice based systems. These features enable DevOps teams to deliver higher quality software in a shorter time. The investment will fuel the development of VAMP’s enterprise-grade features, grow the opensource community and partner network, and boost international expansion. Existing investor Startupbootcamp (SBC) and successful entrepreneur Henri de Jong (Mijndomein) will also participate in the round. Mr. Maene, Volta Ventures’ managing partner, will join the board of directors. 

To solve scaling, performance and time-to-market challenges, digital-savvy organisations are quickly adopting strategies like continuous-delivery, containers and microservices. To unlock the full potential of these technologies to both IT and business, VAMP adds an "experiment system" with canary and autoscaling features that make it safe, fast and easy to release, test and scale new software versions in production.

Successful online companies like Netflix, AirBnB and Facebook have already demonstrated the power of canary testing and releasing. New versions of software are continually released in production to small percentages of visitors, performance is measured and improved, and the number of allowed visitors is gradually increased to achieve a risk-free and stable full release. 

Until recently, it was complex and expensive to apply these canary test and release methods. With VAMP it becomes straightforward and cost effective to add these features to both new or existing architectures. VAMP can work standalone or integrate with container systems like Docker, Mesosphere DC/OS, Azure Container Service, Rancher and Kubernetes.

Frank Maene, managing partner Volta Ventures: *“We like the vision Olaf and his team have on the value add of VAMP in the burgeoning containers and microservices market. We believe VAMP will play an important role in enabling smarter ways of testing, delivering and scaling online software and containers, and we are excited to become a partner of the VAMP team and help to make this happen.”*

Olaf Molenveld, Magnetic.io CEO and co-founder: *“We are very excited to have Volta Ventures, Henri de Jong and SBC on board in our mission to help organisations test, deliver and scale software in a smarter and more effective way. The experience and track-record available in this extended team is huge. It will help us to accelerate the product, the company and the opensource community adoption and we are very much looking forward to work together!”*
