From today onwards, we are open sourcing the development of Vamp, the *Very Awesome Microservice Platform*. Yay!
For me and the team this is quite a milestone and a very exciting next step in how we build Vamp and who contributes
to it. We are still in alpha, so things might still be somewhat rough around the edges, but what Vamp can do 
already surpasses what I had imagined over a year ago! Big up for the team!

So, what can you expect from Vamp and its development?

- Open development on all fronts: open design, open code, easy extending.
- Focus on usability: good documentation, helpful error messages and clear API design.
- Standard where possible: No reinvention if not necessary!

Over the coming weeks and months we will be releasing a lot of write-ups, reference docs and cookbook-type
tutorials on how to use Vamp and what tricks it can do.
