I'm very happy to report we just added an initial set of tutorials to our [getting started section.](/getting-started) These tutorials should get you up and running quickly and help you really kick the tires of Vamp.

In these tutorials, you'll learn how to do simple deployments, do canary releases, use filters and do merges and 
deletes on deployments using blueprints. There's a lot more coming, like tutorials on SLA's, but the key principles are all there. We've also updated the installation steps, outlining some of the restrictions more clearly and adding some extra helpers. 

Of course, we've also finished another sprint and pushed 0.7.0-RC3 which has some important bugfixes. More exciting
is that we started designing and coding the UI for Vamp. Its initial release as part of Vamp Core is planned for
release 0.8.0 at the end of next month, but here's a little sneak peek. 

**Note**: This is very early stage! Lots of things might change!

We hope these updates will help people to get started with Vamp while in alpha but also show where Vamp
is heading in the near future.

Cheers!
