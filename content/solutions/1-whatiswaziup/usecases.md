WAZIUP cutting-edge IoT PaaS platform and software framework support to develop 1000 of IoT applications, out of the box.
Any IoT application that you can imagine.
Due to the PaaS nature WAZIUP IoT PaaS platform enable you to easy and rapid IoT application development.
 
**Agriculture:** The smart farming applications may include monitoring of soil moisture, water storage tanks and field conditions.
It can also track agro-management decisions such as date of sowing, irrigation, fertilizing, tilling.
For example, farmers will be able to monitor the temperature of grain bins (storage areas) and receive an alert if the temperature rises outside of an acceptable range. 

**Fish farming:** WAZIUP enables you to connect a network of sensors to monitor the fish ponds in real time, measuring water temperature, quality, oxygen levels and other parameters.
This will improve the current farm management process by giving farmers the ability to monitor their ponds remotely and in near real-time. 

**Water:** WAZIUP enables you to monitor water quantity, supply, treatment, transportation and storage. Also flood prevention and monitoring is possible.
A water management system based on IoT for rural areas and developing countries can help the community representative monitor and manage water use more efficiently.

**Smart City:** WAZIUP supports various smart city applications like urban waste management, public transportation, street-light monitoring, traffic monitoring, smart parking, waste water management, urban air pollution, tourism, etc. 

**Cattle management:** Cattle rustling is one of the main problem in developing countries.
WAZIUP platform can offer farmer to monitor real-time the cattle situation in order to have viable solution to prevent a theft.
The Farmer will receive alert for any critical condition especially the theft. 

**Healthcare:** WAZIUP allows remote monitoring of patients, such as pregnant woman, patient with diabetics and high-blood pressure, ambient assisted living for the elderly people, and finally child nutrition. 

**Logistic:** WAZIUP Logistic use case may connect “rural” areas (the goods) with the urban areas (the deliveries).
The supply chain ensure that goods (vegetables, fishes) are delivered in an efficient, safe and timely manner to address food safety.
The potential case study are tracking the fleet, check the integrity, identification and authentication and traceability of the goods, monitoring the temperature and cooling condition of the goods.
