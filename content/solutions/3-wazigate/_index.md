WAZIUP IoT LoRa Gateway is an idea solution for remote IoT applications.
The Gateway comes with a module software package which allows to process data locally for local automation.
It also provides an embedded intuitive web administration interface that can also be customized by third-parties, remotely.
Due to Open API and embedded edge computing features at the Gateway level, the applications can be run at locally.
The gateway can easily work without Internet connectivity and still provides data to end-users through its embedded database and web-based visualization module.
Because of the single channel used, the WAZIGATE is an affordable solution for developing countries needsâ€™.
Even the Gateway enable low-cost IoT possibility but it does not decrease the level of functionalities.
The Gateway offers more functionalities than commercial gateways thanks to its open and modular design.
To build your own WAZIGATE you need a Raspberry-pi, a memory sticks and a WAZIHAT. WAZIGATE uses 3G or Ethernet connection in order to send data to the cloud.
The Gateway uses the default connection with the WAZIUP Cloud platform. The Gateway can be connected with both direct power supply as well as solar panel.
The gateway can be used both indoor and outdoor in commercial applications. Due to plug and play, one could need less than 15 minutes to setup a complete IoT infrastructure.
The Gateway push data to Cloud in various way depending on the available internet connectivity (e.g. 3G, WiFi, Ethernet).
A large variety of data upload methods can be used: HTTP REST, FTP, MQTT or even SMS.
Due to LoRa standard, it can communicate upto 10-12 KMs.
