Ecosystem 
WAZIUP developed complete end-to-end, modular and Open IoT technology ecosystem. WAZIUP core module solution are: 

- WAZIDev: IoT LoRa development board based on open source hardware Arduino.  WAZIDev is used for rapid prototyping the sensor node
- WAZIGATE: IoT LoRa Gateway and edge platform based on Raspberry-pi and which includes the software framework for local processing as well as local application deployment 
- WAZICloud: IoT Cloud Platform with open dashboard and Open API for IoT application development 
- WAZIFARM: Farming application platform for advanced farming data analytic and visualization platform 

The sensor node measures the sensing environment → send this data to WAZIUP Gateway using LoRa channel (up to 10kms) → the Gateway processes the data before sending it to WAZIUP Cloud platform via 3G or Ethernet connection →the data can also be accessed by users from Gateway using standard WAZIUP API →the Cloud platform analyzes the data for user’s decision using the farm management applications→ the farmer get information via SMS or Mobile App. 

Why use WAZIUP?
===============

WAZIUP is an IoT Cloud platform that allows you to create and deploy your IoT applications both in the Cloud and on the IoT gateway.
WAZIUP offers “out-of-box” complete solutions from sensors nodes to applicatons.
WAZIUP is particularly adapted to tough conditions, for example for low power and long distance applications.

- Simply and easy to deploy the applications (create, push and run)
- Offer Do-it-Yourself sensors nodes and Gateway solutions (few hours to setup the WAZIUP lORA network)
- Long Range and low power IoT communication
- The platform can handle unreliable and intermitten internet connection
- WAZIUP offers very low cost hardware as well as application developmet solutions
- Multiple fall-back communicaton options (3G, Wifi, BL)
- User centric interface design (SME, voice call, mobile app and web app)
