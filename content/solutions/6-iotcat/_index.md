The ‘IoT Catalogue’ is a web-based catalogue and decision-support tool for solutions of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), not only related to WAZIUP rather in a wider sense.
The ‘IoT Catalogue’ targets especially developers/integrators of IoT systems addressing questions such as: What IoT solutions exist for a given problem?
What components compose a given IoT solution? What is their cost? Where to buy them from? Etc.

 

The ‘IoT Catalogue’ helps in the process of identifying and selecting a group of suitable components that combined work as an IoT solution (able to process, store and transmit data) to a problem defined by the user.
The solutions can present different costs and complexity levels ranging from integrated elements to compositions of components.
