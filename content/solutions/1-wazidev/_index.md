WAZIUP offers two types (e.g. WAZIDev and WAZINano) of development boards for prototyping sensor nodes. WAZIDev is more compact and ready to use for piloting application whereas WAZINano is used for training.  Using WAZIUP Gateway and Cloud platform, the developer can develop a range of IoT application. The board is highly configurable to support wide range of sensors. The board is fully compatible with our technology ecosystem but it is also interoperable and open to integrate with other ecosystems. 


WAZIDEV is a development board with embedded LoRa module that allow the developers to simply develop IoT sensor node as well as IoT actuator node for their IoT applications. 
It offers a fully fledged LoRa development board. It is an ideal solution for start-ups and entrepreneurs who want to rapid prototype a IoT applications.  
-	It supports the Arduino IDE and provided all Arduino standard pins
-	Embedded Lipo battery charger for the applications with solar panel 
-	Two programmable pins with high current support (500mA)
-	Low power option and battery level monitoring features
