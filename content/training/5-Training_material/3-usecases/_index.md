We propose several tutorials based on real-world use cases to get you started with Waziup:

- [Weather station](weather): Develop a complete weather station.
- [Cattle management](cattle): Monitor cattle position with this special collar.
- [Waste management](waste): Build a smart bin warning you when it is full.

All the components can be bought from the [IoT catalog](https://www.iot-catalogue.com/usecases).
