Our tutorials will teach you how to build sensor nodes and gateways based on LoRa technology.
You can build these devices with raw hardware materials that can be bought from online websites.
The sensor nodes are based on Arduino and the gateways are based on Raspberry PI.
Those [video tutorials](videos) will guide you through the steps.
Check-out also our [FAQ on LoRa sensors and gateway](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/FAQ.pdf).

LoRa gateway
------------
These tutorials will help you build a low cost and fully capable LoRa gateway:

- [Step by step guide on construction and configuration of LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf shows how you can build and configure the LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI to start pushing data to the cloud.
- [Web admin interface extension for gateway ] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf explains the web admin interface extension to easily configure and update your gateway.
- [Assembling an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf is a tutorial on how to assemble an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors to match your antenna and radio module connectors. This is mainly required when you want to use a higher gain antenna or when you want to place the antenna outdoor and have your gateway indoor to simplify deployment.
- [Out-door design for Low-cost LoRa gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-outdoor-step-by-step.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-outdoor-step-by-step.pdf shows how you can improve the design for out-door usage.
- [Leaflet for the gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-leaflet.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-leaflet.pdf is a leaflet summarizing the gateway side.


LoRa sensor nodes
-----------------

Those tutorials will help you build a low cost and low power sensor platform:

- [A simple LoRa IoT sensing device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf) shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.
- [All parts need for low-cost device and gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf) lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.
- [A leaflet for the IoT device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf) is a leaflet summarizing the IoT device side.

The next step is to program the LoRa part.
[This repository](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino) will give you the corresponding sketches.


Use cases
