 Welcome on the blog of the IoT project Waziup Fish Farming



The team from [Easy Global Market](http://www.eglobalmark.com/) composed of Sabrine, Charlotte, Franck and me Benjamin are currently working
 on Waziup Project and more precisely on the MVP water part of the project . We decide to take part in the Eclipse IoT Challenge 3.0 with this MVP. This blog will present you our project.

## Description of the project
The goal of the project is to give information to fish farmers located in low income countries about the quality of water in their ponds and support decisions making. From information gathered in the literature, the relevant information for fish ponds monitoring are: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, PH, alkalinity, ammonia, total dissolved solids, carbon dioxide. However, covering all these parameters is highly costly whereas no measures are currently made in the targeted African pond. For our first prototype, we will thus just retrieve temperature, dissolved oxygen and PH and target a trial in a fish farm in Africa, Ghana.
