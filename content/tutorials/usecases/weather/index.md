## Discover here how to prototype a weather station using Waziup.

The objective is to develop a low-cost and sustainable solution capable of reading real-time data typical of a weather station, using different sensors, and capable of communicating via LoRa.
The following subsection are a Getting Strated tutorial.
You can find detailed documentation (here)[WeatherStationGitHub]. 

#### Hardware

The following hardware it's needed to develop your own station:

- (Adafruit Feather 32u4 RFM95 LoRa Radio)[Feather]
- (Adafruit RTC DS3231)[RTC]
- (Sparkfun Weather Shield)[Shield]
- (Wind and Rain sensors Kit)[WindRain]
- (Antenna 868 Mhz)[Antenna]
- (SMA cable)[SMA] 

#### Libraries
You will need that following specific libraries. They are available (here)[Libraries].

- SparkFunHTU21D
- SparkFunMPL3115A2
- RTClib
- LowPower
- Feather_Lib

#### Build & Implementation

You need to follow the next steps to build and implement the Weather Station:

1. **Connect the Wind and Rain sensors to the Weather Shield**;
The Weather Shield come with two unpopulated RJ11 connector spaces that you need to soldering. You need to connect the Wind and the Rain cables to the RJ11 connector.

2. **Connect the Adafruit Feather 32u4 with Sparkfun Weather Shield**;

3. **Connect the Antenna 868 MHz to Feather**;

4. **Weather Station built with components**;

5. **Download the IDE and specific software**;
Don't forget to include the specific libraries. To did this use the Library Manager of your IDE.

6. **Compile the software**;
To this step you need to compile the "WAZIUP_Weather_Station_v1.ino" file. This is a "ready-to-run" file that contains the latest "firmware" to sample the sensors and output data with LoRa communication. Will give you all the sensor data: Temperature, Humidity, Luminosity, Pressor, Supply, Wind Direction, Wind speed and the Amount of Rain. You can see the info in your IDE Serial Monitor and you can also change the file has you want.

#### System Running

The following steps are about how the system works:

1. Power-on the Feather. The script starts automatically when feather is powered on;
2. At the start and during its automatic sensors calibration process the green led appears on (take about 5 seconds). 
3. Wakes-up every 15 min, take all the measurements and send to Gateway.
4. At the moment of reading values by the sensors and send a message to LoRa gateway the blue led turns on and then: If feather does not receive acknowledge then the blue led turns off and Feather sleeps. If feather receive acknowledge from master gateway then the blue led switch to green for 2 seconds, and feathers start sleeping.
5. When Feather sleeps all ledâ€™s are off.
6. Feather wakes up after four minute (by default), get the measurements and send back to master gateway until sleeping again.
