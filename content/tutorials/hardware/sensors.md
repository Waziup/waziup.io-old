Those tutorials will help you build a low cost and low power sensor platform:

- [A simple LoRa IoT sensing device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf) shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.
- [All parts need for low-cost device and gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf) lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.
- [A leaflet for the IoT device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf) is a leaflet summarizing the IoT device side.

[This Website](http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/LORA/WAZIUP/Waziup_Sensor_Tutorial/index.html) gives you all the code for programming simple sensors.
The next step is to program the LoRa part.
[This repository](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino) will give you the corresponding sketches.
