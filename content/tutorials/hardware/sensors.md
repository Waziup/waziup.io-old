Those tutorials will help you build a low cost and low power sensor platform:

- [A simple LoRa IoT sensing device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.
- [All parts need for low-cost device and gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf)low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.
- [A leaflet for the IoT device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf is a leaflet summarizing the IoT device side.
