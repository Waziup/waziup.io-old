There are many tutorial slides/documents describing the WAZIUP hardware frameworks. The main repository with all tutorials can be found on [https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials). You can particularly look for:

- [Low-cost-iot-hardware-parts](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf) that lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-GW leaflet](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-leaflet.pdf) which is a leaflet summarizing the gateway side.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-device leaflet](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf) which is a leaflet summarizing the IoT device side.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf) that shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf) that shows how you can build and configure the LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI to start pushing data to the cloud.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-GW web admin interface tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf) that explains the web admin interface extension to easily configure and update your gateway.
- [Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable tutorial](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf) which is a tutorial on how to assemble an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors to match your antenna and radio module connectors. This is mainly required when you want to use a higher gain antenna or when you want to place the antenna outdoor and have your gateway indoor to simplify deployment.
