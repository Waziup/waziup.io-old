## Hardware Prototyping and Tutorials
We propose several tutorials to get you started with Waziup sensing platform; the following list has been ordered for beginners to get started with introduction upto advanced topics. If you are new in IoT era, you better set off from the first item. For each item, we provide an abstract, and a link to the corresponding online documentation.
The tutorials are a set of training materials to teach you how to build Arduino-based IoT sensor nodes, and Raspberry PI based IoT LoRa gateways. Learners will learn how to build these devices with raw hardware materials that they can buy from online websites.

### â€ŒBackground Materials
- [IoT revolution for everybody] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/iot4all-intro-lr.pdf)  iot4all-intro-lr is a vulgarisation presentation showing how the IoT revolution can be made possible for everybody. It reviews the main IoT technologies then presents the WAZIUP's approach for low-cost IoT. The presentation also shows various real-world deployment campaigns done in the context of WAZIUP.
- [LoRa Frequently Asked Questions] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/FAQ.pdf) FAQ.pdf is our low-cost LoRa framework Frequently Asked Questions. It is advised to read it first.

### LoRa IoT Devices
- [A leaflet for the IoT device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-device-leaflet.pdf is a leaflet summarizing the IoT device side.
- [A simple LoRa IoT sensing device] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.
- [All parts need for low-cost device and gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf)low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.

### LoRa IoT Gateways

- [Leaflet for the gateway] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-leaflet.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-leaflet.pdf is a leaflet summarizing the gateway side.
- [Step by step guide on construction and configuration of LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf shows how you can build and configure the LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI to start pushing data to the cloud.
- [Web admin interface extension for gateway ] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf explains the web admin interface extension to easily configure and update your gateway.
- [Assembling an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf is a tutorial on how to assemble an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors to match your antenna and radio module connectors. This is mainly required when you want to use a higher gain antenna or when you want to place the antenna outdoor and have your gateway indoor to simplify deployment.

### LoRa IoT Demo Kit
- [IoT demo kit for demonstration purposes] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-using-demo-kit.pdf) Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-using-demo-kit.pdf explains how the WAZIUP long-range demo kit can be used for demonstration purposes. It will show how to use the out-of-the-box gateway distribution raspberrypi-jessie-WAZIUP-demo.dmg.zip and the Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp sketch example.
- [WAZIUP Low-cost LoRa IoT framework] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/demo-slides.pdf) demo-slides.pdf is a set of slides that we use for demonstrating our low-cost LoRa IoT framework.

### Videos Tutorials
Finally, there are three tutorial videos on YouTube. They demonstrate in the form of images all the steps to build the whole framework from scratch.

- [Build your low-cost, long-range IoT device with WAZIUP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsKbJeeav_M) Build your low-cost, long-range IoT device with WAZIUP
- [Extreme low-cost & low-power LoRa IoT for real-world deployment] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_VQpcCwdd8) 
- [Build your low-cost LoRa gateway with WAZIUP] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8ItKA14PY)

### Advanced Topics
In addition, the following materials provide more advanced background to IoT technologies.

- [A review of LPWAN technologies] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/RESSACS16-LPWAN-review.pdf) RESSACS16-LPWAN-review.pdf is a review of LPWAN technologies, focusing mainly on LoRa.
- [LPWAN, the low-cost and long-range Internet of Things for developing countries] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/smyle-deploying-low-cost-iot.pdf) 
smyle-deploying-low-cost-iot.pdf is a summary of LPWAN, IoT and WAZIUP's objectives when deploying low-cost and long-range Internet of Things in developing countries. This presentation has been made at SMYLE event in September 2016.
