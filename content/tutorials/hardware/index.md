title: Real world application prototyping
---

In this section you will see how to create real world IoT application prototypes.
We propose several examples:

- [Fish Farming](tutorials/hardware/mvps/water): Discover how to monitor pond water quality.
- [Weather station](tutorials/hardware/mvps/agri): Build a weather station dedicated to support agriculture.
- [Cattle management](tutorials/hardware/mvps/cattle): Build an IoT collar for cows.
- [Urban waste](tutorials/hardware/mvps/urban): Create smart waste bins.
