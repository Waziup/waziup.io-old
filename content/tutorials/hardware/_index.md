Our tutorials will teach you how to build [sensor nodes](sensors) and [gateways](gateways) based on LoRa technology.
You can build these devices with raw hardware materials that can be bought from online websites.
The sensor nodes are based on Arduino and the gateways are based on Raspberry PI.
Those [video tutorials](videos) will guide you through the steps.
Check-out also our [FAQ on LoRa sensors and gateway](https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/FAQ.pdf).
