Cattle Rustling is a recurrent phenomenon causing many problems to farmers in Africa.
In order to prevent the cattle rustling in Africa, WAZIUP proposed a prototype based around recent technological advances, specifically LoRa.
This prototype lies on a built-in low-cost LoRa IoT platform that consist of a single low-cost (LoRa) gateway with post-processing abilities, communicating with low-cost (LoRa) end-devices, and back-ended with an IoT cloud platform.

Open [this PDF] (https://github.com/CongducPham/tutorials/blob/master/Low-cost-LoRa-Collar.pdf) to follow the instructions.
There are 2 versions: a simple beacon version using only the LoRa radio module and a GPS version with a GPS module (UBlox 6/7/8) where GPS coordinates of the collar can be received.
The Arduino code for the collar is available here: simple beacon and GPS.
