title: Split a monolith
---
## Overview

In the [previous tutorial we did some basic canary releasing on two versions of a monolithic application](/documentation/tutorials/run-a-canary-release/). Very nice, but Vamp isn't
called the *Very Awesome Microservices Platform* for nothing. The next step is to split our monolithic Sava application into separate services.

#### In this tutorial we will:

1. define a new service topology
2. learn about environment variables and service discovery

## In depth

### Step 1: Define a new service topology

To prove our point, we are going to slightly "over-engineer" our services solution. This will also help
us demonstrate how we can later remove parts of our solution using Vamp. For now, we'll split the
monolith into a topology of one frontend and two separate backend services. After our engineers
are done with coding, we can catch this new topology in the following blueprint. Please notice a couple
of things:

* We now have three `clusters`: `sava`, `backend1` and `backend2`. Each cluster could have multiple
services on which we could do separate canary releases and set separate filters.
* The `sava` cluster has explicit dependencies on the two backends. Vamp will make sure these dependencies
are checked and rolled out in the right order.
* Using `environment_variables` we connect the dynamically assigned ports and hostnames of the backend
services to the "customer facing" `sava` service.
* We've change the gateway port to `9060` so it doesn't collide with the  monolithic deployment.

```yaml
---
name: sava:1.2
gateways:
  9060: sava/webport
clusters:
  sava:
    services:
      breed:
        name: sava-frontend:1.2.0
        deployable: magneticio/sava-frontend:1.2.0
        ports:
          webport: 8080/http                
        environment_variables:
          BACKEND_1: http://$backend1.host:$backend1.ports.webport/api/message
          BACKEND_2: http://$backend2.host:$backend2.ports.webport/api/message
        dependencies:
          backend1: sava-backend1:1.2.0
          backend2: sava-backend2:1.2.0
      scale:
        cpu: 0.2      
        memory: 64MB
        instances: 1               
  backend1:
    services:
      breed:
        name: sava-backend1:1.2.0
        deployable: magneticio/sava-backend1:1.2.0
        ports:
          webport: 8080/http
      scale:
        cpu: 0.2       
        memory: 64MB
        instances: 1              
  backend2:
    services:
      breed:
        name: sava-backend2:1.2.0
        deployable: magneticio/sava-backend2:1.2.0
        ports:
          webport: 8080/http
      scale:
        cpu: 0.2       
        memory: 64MB
        instances: 1
```

Deploy this blueprint using either the UI or a REST call and when deployed check out the new topology in your browser (on port 9060 this time). When deployed it should yield something similar to:

### Step 2: Learn about environment variables and service discovery

If you were to check out the Docker containers using `docker inspect`, you would see the environment variables that we set in the blueprint.

```bash
> docker inspect 66e64bc1c8ca
...
"Env": [
    "BACKEND_1=http://172.17.42.1:33021/api/message",
    "BACKEND_2=http://172.17.42.1:33022/api/message",
    "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
],
...
```

Host names and ports are configured at runtime and injected in the right parts of your running deployment. Your service/app should pick up these variables to configure itself. Luckily, this is quite easy and common in almost all languages and frameworks.

Remember, there is no "point-to-point" wiring. The exposed host and port are actually service
endpoints. The location, amount and version of containers running behind that service endpoint can vary.

{{< note title="What next?" >}}
* Great! We just demonstrated that Vamp can handle dependencies between services and configure these services with host and port information at runtime. Now let's do a [more complex migration to a new service based topology →](/documentation/tutorials/merge-and-delete/).
