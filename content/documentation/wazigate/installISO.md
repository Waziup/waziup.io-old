Installing your WaziGate with the ISO is simple and easy.
What you need: a Raspberry PI and a WaziHat. First of all, download the ISO image. 

You also need a tool such as [Balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the ISO on your SD card.
Once flashed, you can insert the SD card in your Raspberry PI and power it.
