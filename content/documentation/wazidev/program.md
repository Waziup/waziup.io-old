In this section we will explain how to program your WaziDev. 
First of all, connect your Arduino to your laptop via cable.

In the Arduino IDE, select the following program in the menu: `File/Examples/Arduino_LoRa_Demo_Sensor`.
Then hit "upload" (the arrow button).
You should see the message "Done uploading.".
That's it!
The program will start immediately on the WeziDev and upload data to [the dashboard](http://dashboard.waziup.io/Devices).
If you [configured your gateway](/documentation/wazigate/) correctly, you should see your device appear under your account.

To go further with arduino programming, open our DIY website)[diy.waziup.io). You can find all the sketchs for the various sensors there!
