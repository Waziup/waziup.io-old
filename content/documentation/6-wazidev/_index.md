Pinout description
-------------------------

![WaziDev Pinout](images/pinout.jpg)

1. **ON/OFF switch**: This jumper can be used as on/off switch for the board. It is ON by default.
 
2. **Regulator Activation**: The jumper indicated by **DIRECT / REG** sets the board to use a regulated voltage or direct. The direct setting is only if you use an input battery of maximum 3.6V any voltage higher than that can damage the LoRa module. 
**Please note that to always keep this config in REG mode when programming the board.**
 
3. **Analog Pins**: Arduino standard analog pins A0-A7. Please note that **A7** is connected to the battery voltage level monitoring circuit which can be activated by setting the digital pin **D7** to **LOW**, so **D7** should be set to **HIGH** always.
 
4. **External Antenna (UFL)**: The board has an embedded PCB antenna which is activated by default and optimized for 868Mhz frequency. If you want to use your own antenna instead you need to deactivate the PCB antenna by cutting its jumper on the back of the board indicated by **JA** then you can connect your antenna to the UFL connector.
 
6. **High current pins** ( *max 500mA* ): **M8** and **M9** are high current/voltage programmable output pins. 
They can be programmed through digital pins **D8** and **D9** respectively. 
It can be used to activate high current/voltage devices/sensors. 
The maximum current which can be drained is **500mA** and the maximum voltage is **12v**. 
The wiring is as follows: The Ground wire of the external high current/voltage source is connected to the same ground of the board (GND), and the positive wire of the power source is connected to the high current device that needs to be controlled by our board. 
One of the pins of **M8** or **M9** is connected to the Ground of the high current device, then we can turn it on and off by writing **HIGH** and **LOW** to the digital pins **D8** or **D9** respectively.
 
7. **Digital Pins**: Arduino standard digital pins **D2-D12**. Please note that **D13** is situated on the opposite side of **D12**.
 
8. **VCC** ( *3.3v* ): WaziDev board operates with **3.3v**, VCC pins provide 3.3v as output, they can be used as input voltage as well.

9. *Lipo/regular battery*: This port is designed to be used as input for Lithium Ion rechargeable battery or just a regular battery. There is an onboard charger which enables the board to use a solar panel. 
Please note that the solar panel must be connected to either Micro *USB port* or *VIN* pin.
**Warning**: your rechargeable battery must have its own protection circuit otherwise it might gets overcharged and cause fire. (usually good quality batteries have it)
 
10. **Micro USB port**: This port is used to power the board on through USB cable and program the board via Arduino IDE. Please note that you need to first install the driver on your computer:
	- Windows: https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/9/7/Windows-CH340-Driver.zip
	- Linux: https://github.com/juliagoda/CH341SER
	- Mac: https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/9/7/CH341SER_MAC.ZIP

To programm the board, in Arduino IDE, on the boards menu, you need to select **Arduino Pro or Mini, ATMega328p 3.3v @ 8MHz**.
