Vamp can talk directly to a Docker daemon and its driver is configured by default. This is useful for local testing. Vamp can even run inside Docker while deploying to Docker.  You can pass native Docker options by [using the Docker dialect in a Vamp blueprint.](/documentation/using-vamp/blueprints/#dialects). Docker Swarm support is coming soon.

#### Set container driver
