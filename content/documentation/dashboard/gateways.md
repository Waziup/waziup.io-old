In this section, we'll learn how to connect and configure your gateway on the Waziup Dashboard.
If you install the [WaziGate](/documentation/wazigate/), it should already appear in this page.

![Gateways list](../images/gateways_list.png)

The small symbol next to the gateway icon shows if your gateway is currently connected. It should appear green if connected.
Now click on your gateway to open the details page.

The details page shows the name, privacy and ID of your gateway.
It also shows all the devices that are connected to that gateway.
You can click a device to navigate to that device.

You can open the own Gateway UI by clicking on the "Remote access" button.
This will open the [login screen for your gateway UI](/documentation/wazigate/login).

Finally, you can edit the paramters of your gateway and delete it, using the corresponding buttons.
