A project allows you to get all your assets in the same place: gateways, devices, notifications, maps, graphics...

The first thing to do is to connect your [gateways](/documentation/dashboard/gateways/) and [devices](/documentation/dashboard/gateways/).
Once they are connected, you can click on the button "Create a project".
