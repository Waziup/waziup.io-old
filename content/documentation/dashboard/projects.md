A project allows you to get all your assets in the same place: gateways, devices, notifications, maps, graphics...
The first thing to do is to connect your [gateways](/documentation/dashboard/gateways/) and [devices](/documentation/dashboard/gateways/).
Once they are connected, you can click on the button "Create a project".

After completing all the steps, your project is ready!
You can see on this screen the status of your devices and gateways.

If your devices are positionned, you should see them on the map.
Finally, all devices and sensor values are displayed on the graph.
