Clicking on the “Devices” menu entry will lead you to the devices page.
 
![Devices page](../images/devices.png)

In this list, active sensors are displayed in green, and unactive sensors are in red.
A sensor is deemed unactive if it doesn't send data after 12 hours.
The sensors are sorted by domains, which regroup sensors from the same application domain: for example sensors from a specific farm.

If you configured your gateway correctly, you should be able to find your sensor in this page!
Press CTRL-F and enter part of your name, in order to find your sensor in the page.
Your data is already here!
Click on the sensor icon to access to the details.

Setting up you sensor
---------------------

Without any configuration, you can already see your sensor value and historic.
Click on the graph icon to consult the graphics.

However, we need to "enrich" our sensor by providing some metadata.
Click on the "Change" button on the map in order to set up the sensor location.
Click on the little pen icon to input the sensor name.
This operation will allow you to recognize your sensor more easily.

Click on the pen icon in the measurement box.
This will allow to set up:

- a measurement name
- a sensing device. This is the kind of physical sensor used: a temperature sensor, a soil moisture sensor...
- a quantity kind. This is what you are really measuring with the sensor. For example, air temperature or water temperature?
- a unit of measurement.

Setting up this metadata is not mandatory, however is it much better to get if you want to exploit yuor data on the long term.
It will also allow you to create nicer graphics.
