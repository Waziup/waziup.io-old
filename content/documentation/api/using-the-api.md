title: Using the Vamp API
---
{{< note title="New in Vamp 0.9.1" >}}
We've now added support for Websockets to our HTTP API. More information will follow soon.

Vamp has one REST API. This page explains how to specify pagination, and json and yaml content types, and how to effectively use the Vamp REST API.

## Content types

* Vamp requests can be in YAML format or JSON format. Set the `Content-Type` request header to `application/x-yaml` or `application/json` accordingly.
* Vamp responses can be in YAML format or JSON format. Set the `Accept` request header to `application/x-yaml` or `application/json` accordingly.

## Pagination

Vamp API endpoints support pagination with the following scheme:

* Request parameters `page` (starting from 1, not 0) and `per_page` (by default 30) e.g:

```
GET http://vamp:8080/api/v1/breeds?page=5&per_page=20
```

* Response headers `X-Total-Count` giving the total amount of items (e.g. 349673) and a `Link` header for easy traversing, e.g.
```
X-Total-Count: 5522
Link:
  <http://vamp:8080/api/v1/events/get?page=1&per_page=5>; rel=first,
  <http://vamp:8080/api/v1/events/get?page=1&per_page=5>; rel=prev,
  <http://vamp:8080/api/v1/events/get?page=2&per_page=5>; rel=next,
  <http://vamp:8080/api/v1/events/get?page=19&per_page=5>; rel=last
```

See [Github's implementation](https://developer.github.com/guides/traversing-with-pagination/) for more info.

## Return codes

* Create & Delete operations are idempotent: sending the second request with the same content will not result to an error response (4xx).
* An update will fail (4xx) if a resource does not exist.
* A successful create operation has status code 201 `Created` and the response body contains the created resource.
* A successful update operation has status code 200 `OK` or 202 `Accepted` and the response body contains the updated resource.
* A successful delete operation has status code 204 `No Content` or 202 `Accepted` with an empty response body.

## Sending multiple artifacts (documents) - `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`

It is possible to send YAML document containing more than 1 artifact definition:

```
GET /api/v1
```

Supported methods are `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. Example:

```yaml
---
name: ...
kind: breed
# breed definition ...
---
name: ...
kind: blueprint
# blueprint definition ...
```

Additional `kind` field is required and it always correspond (singular form) to type of the artifact.
For instance if specific endpoint would be `/api/v1/deloyments` then the same deployment request can be sent to `api/v1` with additional `kind: deployment`.
If specific endpoints are used (e.g. `/api/v1/blueprints`) then `kind` needs to be ommited.
