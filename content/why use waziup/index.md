title: Why use Vamp?
---

We recognise the pain and risk involved with delivering microservice applications.  We've been there too - facing downtime and unexpected issues while transitioning from one release to the next. 
In microservice architectures, these concerns can quickly multiply. It's all too easy to get stuck dealing with the added complexities and miss out on the potential benefits.

## What is Vamp?

Vamp is an open source, self-hosted platform for managing (micro)service oriented architectures that rely on container technology. Vamp provides a DSL to describe services, their dependencies and required runtime environments in blueprints and a runtime/execution engine to deploy these blueprints (similar to AWS Cloudformation). Planned deployments and running services can be managed from your choice of Vamp interface - graphical UI, command line interface or RESTful API. 

Vamp takes care of route updates, metrics collection and service discovery, so you can easily orchestrate complex deployment patterns, such as architecture level A/B testing and canary releases.
After deployment, Vamp workflows monitor running applications and can act automatically based on defined SLAs.
